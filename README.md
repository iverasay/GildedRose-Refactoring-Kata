# Csharp Refactoring

To solve the *“Gilded Rose”* requirements, which must update products, the *Csharp*  project was modified. 

Below I describe the classes that compose them:

- The **Item** class serves to contain all the information related to the products that must be updated daily.
- The **Helper** class serves to typify the products, so that they can be classified and updated accordingly.
- The **GildedRose** class is responsible for updating the products, based on the business rules defined for each type of product.
- The **Program** class is responsible for bringing all this to life. In its Main method, a series of elements are loaded and then updated with the passing of days. Simulate the passing of days.
- The **GildedRoseTest** class contains a series of tests with various cases related to the update and the expected results for each case. Useful for future modifications.
- The **ApprovalTest** class contains a verification's method of results that confronts a previously defined text (*expected output*), with the text generated by the current compilation, in order to validate whether the new code continues to produce the same output.

*I must clarify that in a more complex context, a more robust and modular solution must be developed, abstracting the logic in several layers, where each one provides a specific functionality, giving the solution more independence and scalability.*
